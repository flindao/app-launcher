AppLauncher
-----------

AppLauncher allows running Smart TV and STB application avoiding standard
installation process.

AppLauncher lets to create list of applications URLs to run. URLs are sorted
according to last activities: adding or launching.

Install AppLauncher once and easily run dozens of your applications at Smart TV
or STB.

 

Important details:

1.  You have to run web-server to provide application URL to run. AppLauncher
    works only with URLs, not ipk or zip files!

2.  AppLauncher could not check applications URLs before running them due to
    platforms limitations. Be careful while entering URL. Improper URL can
    cause Smart TV/STB hang-up. Reboot your Smart TV/STB in this situation.

3.  You can use remote control digital buttons to enter digits into URL instead
    of using screen keyboard.
